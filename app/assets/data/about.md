Hi, I'm Tareq Alyousef.

I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics with a data science concentration on a pre-med track at the University of Memphis.

I've been creating video games ever since I discovered the Blender Game Engine when I was 12 years old. Over these years, I've picked up skills in programming, modeling, animating, and texturing.

These interests later grew into data science--today, I study financial markets through algorithmic trading.
